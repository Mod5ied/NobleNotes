# GOOGLE FONTS TO BE USED AND INSTANCES OF USE

1. Font1(Quicksand):
    This font should be used for the entire body section except for the date-line div

2. Font2(Lemonada):
    This font should be used for the date-line div.

# FOR THE COURSES SECTIONS 

The 'Current Notes' section would contain all notes that are COS, which would of course be specified by
the "note specifier at the bottom"
The 'Previous Notes' section would also do the same as did Current Notes.
